  <h1>Why am I taking this course?</h1>
  <p>There are a few reasons I'm taking this course:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I needed the units</li>
    <li>Actually, that's about it.</li>
    <li>Except the last course with Rio (CIT82) was great, so why not do that again? </li>
    <li>Except now I have even less time and don't really need the units anymore...</li>
  </ul>
